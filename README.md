### Implemented dimensionality reduction:

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 

Used UCI Dorothea Data Set, using a significantly large subset of 50K real features (neglected the probe feature). Further implemented a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier in the resulting K-dimensional PCA space (where K=100 500 and 1000) as well as 1-dimensional LDA space and reported the classification performance on validation data.


## Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis (KLDA)

Used UCI Arcene cancer classification dataset and Madelon Dataset that have real vectorial data representation for testing. Report is documented in "report.pdf".
